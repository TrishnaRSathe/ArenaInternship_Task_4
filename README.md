The Employee Management System is a console-based Java application designed to efficiently manage employee records. It allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete employees, as well as generate reports such as department summaries, salary statistics, and employee counts by position. The system stores employee data persistently in a file (employees.dat) so that records are retained across sessions. With a simple menu-driven interface, it automatically records the date of joining and formats salaries for easy reading, making it a practical tool for small organizations to maintain and analyze employee information.
